HTML
- One use of each type of header <h1>-<h6>
- One use of <div> with flex layout. Hint: flex is useful for adding arbitrarily many containers into a space.
- One use of <div> with grid layout. Hint: grid is useful for aligning and laying out several similar containers.
- One use of <a>. This must be set to open in a new tab.
- One use of <img>
- One use of <button>. The button can do anything.
- One use of <title> and <author>. Hint: this should go in the <head>
- One functional component. This should be something quirky that shows off your knowledge. It should be a form input that triggers some JavaScript function. It does not have to do something that is necessarily useful, it only has to do something. This will be graded on the following component:
- Use of JavaScript from a <script> tag
- Use of a <form> component, with a <label> and <input> (can be of any input type).
- Use of a <submit> button.

CSS
- * selector
